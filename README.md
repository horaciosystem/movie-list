Movie List
=============

> A movie list built with react native. Movies are provided by Rotten Tomatoes API.

I made it following a tutorial from facebook docs.
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html


## Build
Inside of the project's root directory
```sh
# Build the app to an android device
react-native run-android
```

## Live Reload
Inside of the project's root directory
```sh
# Keep this packager running while developing on any JS projects.
npm start
```

## Funny Facts
> It's my first react native app.
